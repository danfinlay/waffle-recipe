# Dan's Waffle Recipe

I was given a waffle iron as a gift over the holidays, and am tracking the evolution of my waffle recipe here.

## My Iron

I am using a [Cuisinart WAF-V100](https://www.cuisinart.com/shopping/appliances/waffle_makers/waf-v100) which is notable because it involves pouring batter into the iron vertically, meaning all of my recipes will have the requirement of being thin enough to pour in this model.

## Recipe

2 eggs
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup coconut flour
1 3/4 cups milk or water (could probably use other liquids)
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 tablespoon white sugar
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Add water/milk as needed to thin to a pourable level.

Toast at level 4 for a nice golden brown.
