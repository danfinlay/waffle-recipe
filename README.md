# Dan's Waffle Recipe

I was given a waffle iron as a gift over the holidays, and am tracking the evolution of my waffle recipe here.

## My Iron

I am using a [Cuisinart WAF-V100](https://www.cuisinart.com/shopping/appliances/waffle_makers/waf-v100) which is notable because it involves pouring batter into the iron vertically, meaning all of my recipes will have the requirement of being thin enough to pour in this model.

## Recipe

- 2 eggs
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- 1/2 cup banana flour
- 1/4 cup coconut flour
- 1/8 cup pea protein
- 1/8 cup oatmeal
- 1 3/4 cups milk or water (could probably use other liquids)
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 4 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Add water/milk as needed to thin to a pourable level.

Toast at level 4 for a nice golden brown.
