# Dan's Waffle Recipe

I was given a waffle iron as a gift over the holidays, and am tracking the evolution of my waffle recipe here.

## My Iron

I am using a [Cuisinart WAF-V100](https://www.cuisinart.com/shopping/appliances/waffle_makers/waf-v100) which is notable because it involves pouring batter into the iron vertically, meaning all of my recipes will have the requirement of being thin enough to pour in this model.
